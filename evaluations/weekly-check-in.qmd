title: Questions
---

Every week, after you finish working through the content, I want to hear about what you learned and what questions you still have. To facilitate this, and to encourage engagement with the course content, you'll need to fill out a short questionnaire. This should be ~150 words. 

You should answer the following three questions each week:

1. What was the most exciting thing you learned from the session? Why?
2. What was the muddiest thing from the session this week? What are you still wondering about?   
3. Which activity did you find the most useful? What could have been skipped?
